This is an Eclipse project which depends on the OpenCV library. Including the library can be done by following the instructions on this web page:
http://docs.opencv.org/trunk/doc/tutorials/introduction/java_eclipse/java_eclipse.html

Other dependencies include the github repository at https://github.com/lbehnke/hierarchical-clustering-java
The necessary files are packaged in hierarchical.jar

SSIM implementations (if functioning) are based on http://docs.opencv.org/doc/tutorials/gpu/gpu-basics-similarity/gpu-basics-similarity.html
